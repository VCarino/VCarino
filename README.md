# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Voughn Carino!

Welcome to my GitHub space! ðŸŒ±

I'm a beginner developer with a passion for crafting beautiful and functional websites.  
Currently, I know **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**â€”the building blocks of the web.  
I am now learning **PHP** and **Laravel** to expand my horizons into backend development and modern frameworks.

As I grow, I hope to share my journey, projects, and progress here.  
If you have tips, advice, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
